# Exome Sequencing Analysis of 582 Chinese Epilepsy Trios Negative for Known Gene Mutations
Epilepsy is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in children, with a significant genetic component. This study aimed to investigate the genetic landscape of epilepsy in a large cohort of Chinese children, identify novel epilepsy-associated genes, and explore their potential for clinical translation. We conducted exome sequencing (ES) on 963 Chinese proband-parent trios with a range of epilepsy phenotypes. We characterized the variant landscape in known epilepsy-associated genes and identified novel candidate genes by analyzing 582 trios that yielded negative results for known gene mutations. These novel candidates were subsequently validated using zebrafish and cellular models. We identified five novel epilepsy candidate genes in at least two unrelated probands. Functional studies in zebrafish and cellular models provided further support for the role of these genes in epileptogenesis.
